SYNOPSIS
    destroy(id: string)

DESCRIPTION
    destroy is used to deactivate an entity. By calling it with a valid
    entity UUID it will cause the driver to make sure that the entity is
    no longer available.

    However this does not implicitly mean that the entity is deleted and
    its memory is freed right away. The driver has the liberty to only
    disable it and wait until the next cache cleanup interval to free
    all associated memories.
