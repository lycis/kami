NAME
    Driver Intiailisation

DESCRIPTION
    When the game driver starts it is initialised by executing the so called
    'init script'. The relative path within the driver sytem libraries is passed
    via the '--init=<path>' command line option on startup and by default is
    assumed to be '/system/init.js'.

    The initialisation flow is

        1. Set driver basics (e.g. logging levels, input folders and files, ...)
        2. Load and compile init script
        3. Execute init script
        4. Start world loop

    The most important part here is the loading and execution of the init script.
    This the basic entry point that you have to define the game engine behaviour
    as it is expected to set up the complete game library and world. For example
    it is supposed to set according driver hooks to allow user interaction and
    instantiate entities that will manage the game flow.

    The init script itself will be executed with Root privileges. So any code
    that you define in there will be able to access the most critical driver
    functions.

    The driver will shut down if an error occurs within the initialisation
    script.
