NAME
    Driver Hooks

DESCRIPTION
    The Kami driver supports a variety of driver hooks that are used to hook
    into differnt points of the driver execution. The are set by using the
    dfun "set_driver_hook(hook: int, value)" and represent numerically where
    each number refers to one specific hook. The value may vary between 
    the different hooks so that one hook might expect to get a function pointer
    while anther one expects strings or numbers.

    0	(H_HB_ON_ERROR)		function_ptr that will be executed when an error
				occurs within the heartbeat processing. Function
                                signature has to be:
					f(entity, error)

    1	(H_WHEN_WORLD_RUN) 	function_ptr that will be executed when the world
                                enters the "running" state but before the actual
                                world loop was called. This indicates that the
                                driver was initialised correctly. Function sig:
   					f()

   2	(H_NEW_USER)		function_ptr that will be executed when a new
				user is connected to the game. Function signature:
					f(): tokenString

   3	(H_USER_INPUT)		function_ptr that will be called when input is
				available for a user. signature:
					H_USER_INPUT(userToken: string, input: string)

   4	(H_USER_DELETE)		function_ptr to invalidate a user token. When the
				according function is called it expected that
				further user interaction will not be possible and
				all resources of the user are deleted. signature:
					H_USER_DLETE(userToken: string)
