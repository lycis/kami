NAME
    Driver Hooks

DESCRIPTION
    The Kami driver supports a variety of driver hooks that are used to hook
    into differnt points of the driver execution. The are set by using the
    dfun "set_driver_hook(hook: int, value)" and represent numerically where
    each number refers to one specific hook. The value may vary between 
    the different hooks so that one hook might expect to get a function pointer
    while anther one expects strings or numbers.

    1	(H_HB_ON_ERROR)		function_ptr that will be executed when an error
				occurs within the heartbeat processing. Function
                                signature has to be:
					f(entity, error)

    2	(H_WHEN_WORLD_RUN) 	function_ptr that will be executed when the world
                                enters the "running" state but before the actual
                                world loop was called. This indicates that the
                                driver was initialised correctly. Function sig:
					f()
