NAME
    Subsystems

DESCRIPTION
    The Kami driver supports various subsystems. A subsystem is a separate unit
    that can be enabled or disabled by driver and runs in parallel. Different
    subsystems take over different responsibilities. The key principle is that
    they run detached from the driver and interact with it when needed.

    Supported subsystems:
        D_SUBSYSTEM_REST	0	REST endpoint subsystem (networking)
