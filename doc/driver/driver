NAME
    driver

DESCRIPTION
    The driver is the base component of the Kami _Driver_. It is the master
    process that handles all in-world interactions, scripts and exections.

    When starting it will first initialse by calling the init script. By
    default is expected to be located in <libdir>/sys/init.js but you may
    override the location by starting Kami with the appropriate switches.

    The init script will run with ROOT privileges and is supposed to set up all
    required entities and invocations to run your game library. The init script
    is also the only script intance that will be created with ROOT privileges 
    by default and uses the driver itself as its associated entity.

    After the init script was executed successfully the driver will enter the
    running state and execute the "world loop" that takes care of e.g. calling
    the heartbeat.

    The init script can also be used to set specific driver hooks.
