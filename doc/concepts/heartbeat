CONCEPT
    Heartbeat

DESCRIPTION
    The heratbeat is an internal interval that the driver uses to execute some
    functionality within entities. By default the heartbeat will occur roughly
    all 2 seconds. It is not necessarily fixed to that interval as the driver
    may take a bit longer for working through internal tasks in each iteration.
    It is guaranteed though that the timer takes at least 2 seconds by default.

    When the heartbeat is executed it will call the $tick function for each
    entity that is active and defines it.
