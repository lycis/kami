NAME
    Privileges

DESCRIPTION
    Within the game driver each entity that runs a script has a ertain privilege
    level attached. This level indicates which parts of the scripting API are
    allowed to be used by this entity.

    The privilege levels range from numerical 0 through 10. Currently only
    three levels are used:
        
        0	None	No script API access
	1	Basic	Access to non-critical functions
	10	Root	Access to all (including critical) functions

    Basically a script gets access to all functions that its privilege level
    allows. Functions of a higher level are simply not available. For example
    when trying to call 'shutdown("being naughty");' from an entity script
    that is executed with privilege level 1 (Basic) you will get an error because
    'shutdown' is not defined for this script. If you execute the same script
    with a privilege level 10 (Root) the driver will shutdown.

    Usually every entity has the Basic (1) privilege level. You can control the
    level by using the 'grant_privilege(...)' function but you are not allowed
    to grant a higher privilege level than the script executing the function has.

    For example if you execute 'grant_privilege(<uid>, 10);' within a script
    that only has privilege level 1 (Basic) itself the call will fail. If you
    execute the same snippet from a script with Root privileges (e.g. the
    init-script) it will suceed and elevate the target entity to Root privileges.

    By default the only entity that has Root (10) privilege by default is the
    game driver itself. So to pass this privilege onwards you have to 
    'grant_privilege' according entities from within the init-script that is
    executed on startup.
